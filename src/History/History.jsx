                    James Marshall "Jimi" Hendrix (born Johnny Allen Hendrix; November 27, 1942 - September 18, 1970) was an American guitarist, singer and songwriter. Although his mainstream career spanned only four years, he is widely regarded as one of the most influential electric guitarists in the history of popular music, and one of the most celebrated musicians of the 20th century. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame describes him as "arguably the greatest instrumentalist in the history of rock music."

                    <p>
                    Guitar legend Jimi Hendrix is born in Seattle. Hendrix grew up playing guitar, imitating blues greats like Muddy Waters as well as early rockers. He joined the army in 1959 and became a paratrooper but was honorably discharged in 1961 after an injury that exempted him from duty in Vietnam.

                    <h2>Best guitarist ever</h2>
                    <p>
                    Jimi Hendrix is considered the greatest electric guitar player of all time. This honor is bestowed upon him not only by fans and musicians everywhere but also by scholars and most guitar legends. Contrary to what one might think, technique was not his forte. Sure, Hendrix had great facility on the instrument, but his greatest strengths were his otherworldly creativity and unmatched ability to connect with an audience.
